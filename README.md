# NAPER: Ensemble-based Protection for Real-Time Resource-Constrained Deep Neural Networks

Resource-constrained systems with limited computational capabilities increasingly integrate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to achieve high-accuracy results within constrained response times. However, memory bit-flips pose significant challenges, jeopardizing accuracy and timely response. Current solutions often grapple with trade-offs between reliability and accuracy. In response to these challenges, we introduce NAPER, a novel approach adeptly designed to navigate these trade-offs. NAPER capitalizes on the dual-mode operation of multioutput DNNs in a real-time system. In stable conditions, it optimizes accuracy while adhering to inference deadlines. During bit-flip anomalies, it prioritizes minimal recovery time, ensuring accuracy thresholds and inference deadlines are met. At its core, NAPER employs an innovative ensemble DNN model that uses redundancy to augment, rather than compromise, accuracy. Our evaluations underscore NAPER's capability, showcasing a 3.56% higher accuracy preservation compared to conventional strategies and guaranteeing uninterrupted operation. As the role of DNNs amplifies in resource-constrained systems, NAPER emerges as a trailblazer, setting benchmarks in mitigating memory bit-flip challenges and elevating system reliability.
